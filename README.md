# Music analysis and Year prediction
A subset of the Million Song Dataset is used.
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/msd-audio-features) available on Kaggle.

An initial trend analysis of the Billboard charts from 1950 to 2015 :

Prediction of the release year of a song given its timbre averages and covariances, using linear regression.

We try to reduce the prediction error by implementing a neural network.

These were trained using Kaggle kernels and the links to those are available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/raghav1810/release-year-prediction-on-msd) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/raghav1810/release-year-prediction-on-msd-using-neural-nets) respectively.
